## Cairo

The following software may be included in this product: Cairo. Use of any of this software is governed by
        the terms of the license below:

Cairo is free software.

Every source file in the implementation[*] of cairo is available to be redistributed and/or modified under
        the terms of either the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public License
        (MPL) version 1.1.  Some files are available under more liberal terms, but we believe that in all cases, each
        file may be used under either the LGPL or the MPL.

See the following files in this directory for the precise terms and conditions of either license:

 Jump to LGPL Version 2.1

 Jump to MPL Version 1.1

Please see each file in the implementation for copyright and licensing information, (in the opening comment
        of each file).

[*] The implementation of cairo is contained entirely within the "src" and "pixman" directories of the cairo
        source distribution. There are other components of the cairo source distribution (such as the "test" and
        "perf") that are auxiliary to the library itself. None of the source code in these directories contributes to a
        build of the cairo library itself, (libcairo.so or cairo.dll or similar).

These auxiliary components are also free software, but may be under different license terms than cairo
        itself. For example, most of the test cases in the perf and test directories are made available under a MIT
        license to simplify any use of this code for reference purposes in using cairo itself. Other files might be
        available under the GNU General Public License (GPL), for example. Again, please see the opening comment of
        each file for copyright and licensing information.

## Freetype Library

The following software may be included in this product: Freetype. Use of any of this software is governed by
        the terms of the license below:

### 0. Definitions

Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of
        files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType
        Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.

`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using' is a generic term including
        compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'. This program is
        referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine'.

This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code,
        binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed
        in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you
        must contact us to verify this.

The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All
        rights reserved except as specified below.

### 1. No Warranty

THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
        BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF
        THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE
        FREETYPE PROJECT.

### 2. Redistribution

This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, execute,
        perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in
        both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to
        exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:

Redistribution of source code must retain this license file ('FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions,
            deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. The
            copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files.

Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part
            of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to
            the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the
        unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us.

### 3. Advertising

Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial,
        advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission.

We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software
        in your documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine', `FreeType library', or
        `FreeType Distribution'.

As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is
        copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to
        use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you
        indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.

### 4. Contacts

freetype@freetype.org

Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and wanted additions to the library
        and distribution. If you are looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything to help you
        in the documentation.

### Why Three Licenses?

The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD License, and since the IJG
        License effectively subsumes the distribution conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively
        placed libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License. However, the IJG License specifically refers
        to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.
        Thus, it was desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code that were granted
        to the IJG for code derived from their software.

### IJG JPEG Library License

In plain English:

We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!) 

You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.

You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge
            somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software,
        its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS
        IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for
        any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:

If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be
            included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to
            the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.

If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this
            software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".

Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any
            undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified
        library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity
        relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the
        Independent JPEG Group's software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided
        that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its
        copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and
        conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you
        must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since
        ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
        the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free
        Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess,
        config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also
        freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T,
        and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For
        this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic
        coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
        implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
        code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the
        Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
        produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are
        larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.

We are required to state that

### The zlib/libpng License (Zlib)

This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty. In no event will the authors be

            software. If you use this software in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be
            appreciated but is not required.

Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be misrepresented as being the
            original software.

        "Linux Libertine" is a Reserved Font Name for this Font Software.

Graphite extension of the original Linux Libertine font was made by Laszlo Nemeth under the same

        Our fonts are free in the sense of the GPL. In short: Changing the font is allowed as long as the derivative
        work is published under the same license again. Pedantics keep claiming that the embedded use of GPL-fonts in
        i.e. PDFs requires the free publication of the PDF as well. This is why our GPL contains the so called "font
        exception".

        portions of this font into the document, this font does not by itself cause the resulting document to be
        covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the
        document might be covered by the GNU General Public License. If you modify this font, you may extend this
        exception to your version of the font, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete
        this exception statement from your version.

Additionally our fonts are licensed under the Open Fonts License (see below).

        not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and
        sold with any software provided that the font names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives,
        however, cannot be released under any other type of license.

# Common Public License Version 1.0 (CPL)

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY
        USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this
            Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that
            particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
            such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
            additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
            Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by
        the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all
        Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
            worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
            publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
            derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
            worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
            otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This
            patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
            Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
            covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include
            the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set
            forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent
            or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
            Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
            otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
            assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example,
            if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's
            responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its
            Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,
        provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and
            implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
            conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct,
            indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor
            alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs
            licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
            exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
        reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users,
        business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
        the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does
        not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
        commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
        every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
        "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
        Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
        connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
        section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
        infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
        Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
        the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor
        may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That
        Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or
        offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial
        Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims
        against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
        other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
        WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient
        is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
        risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and
        costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
        unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY
        LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT
        LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
        OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR
        THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
        the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by
        the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
        valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to
        software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
        Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
        addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
        in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
        hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall
        terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
        material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
        after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient
        agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
        obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
        and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid
        inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement
        Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
        No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement
        Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity.
        Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
        Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received.
        In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
        (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
        above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
        Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly
        granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of
        the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more
        than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting
        litigation.

## 2. Source Code License.

### 2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.

The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third
    party intellectual property claims:

under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable
        by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code
        (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of Original
        Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original
        Code (or portions thereof).

the licenses granted in this Section 2.1 (a) and (b) are effective on the date
        Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of this License.

Notwithstanding Section 2.1 (b) above,
        no patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original
        Code; or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the
        Original Code with other software or devices.

### 2.2. Contributor Grant.

Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide,
    royalty-free, non-exclusive license

under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable
        by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
        created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as
        Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
        Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or
        portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1)
        Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by
        that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).

the licenses granted in Sections 2.2 (a) and 2.2 (b) are effective on the date
        Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.

Notwithstanding Section 2.2 (b) above,
        no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2)
        separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
        Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software
        (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered
        Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

## 3. Distribution Obligations.

### 3.1. Application of License.

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,
    including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered
    Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
    Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of
    the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
    restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
    additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

### 3.2. Availability of Source Code.

Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under
    the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
    Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via
    Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
    initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
    has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains
    available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

### 3.3. Description of Modifications.

You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to
    create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification
    is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
    the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
    documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

### 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to
    exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
    "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know
    whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
    Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
    Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
    newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
    obtained.

If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of
    patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include
    this information in the legal file.

Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's
    original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

### 3.5. Required Notices.

You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.
    If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
    include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a
    notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described
    in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the
    Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to
    offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
    Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
    Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
    is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability terms You offer.

### 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the
    Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of
    how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
    must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which
    You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
    Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version
    does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in
    this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
    that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
    by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

### 3.7. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License
    and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
    License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

## 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
    Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
    to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
    included in the legal file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
    ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

## 5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

## 6. Versions of the License.

### 6.1. New Versions

Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from
    time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

### 6.2. Effect of New Versions

Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use
    it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent
    version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms
    applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

### 6.3. Derivative Works

If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code
    which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
    "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
    license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your
    version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License.
    (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

## 7. Disclaimer of warranty

Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis, without warranty of
    any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of
    defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and
    performance of the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you (not the
    initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair or correction. This
    disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this license. No use of any covered code is authorized
    hereunder except under this disclaimer.

## 8. Termination

8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
    You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
    All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.
    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding
    declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor
    against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
        patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
        days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You
        either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
        future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
        the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment
        arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,
        the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
        2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period
        specified above.

any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor
        Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under
        Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are
        revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by
        that Participant.

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
    Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
    by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of
    the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
    license.

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements
    (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
    termination shall survive termination.

## 9. Limitation of liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of
    covered code, or any supplier of any of such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such
    party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to
    liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law
    prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
    consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.

## 10. U.S. government end users

The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software
    documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
    1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June
    1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

## 11. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
    License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
    enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
    any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
    party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any
    litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
    District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for
    costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of
    the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
    regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to
    this License.

## 12. Responsibility for claims

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising,
    directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
    Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

## 13. Multiple-licensed code

Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means
    that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the
    MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in
    Exhibit A.

## Exhibit A - Mozilla Public License.

NOTE: The text of this Exhibit A may differ slightly from the text of the notices in the Source Code files of
    the Original Code. You should use the text of this Exhibit A rather than the text found in the Original Code Source
    Code for Your Modifications.

### 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and
            You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by

            and

such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and
            You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
            reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient;
            and

You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under
            different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
            recipients´ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under
            different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
            recipients´ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

### 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the
    requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
    a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary
    Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such
    Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
    Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

### 3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices,
    disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
    Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual
    inaccuracies.

### 3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one
    or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
    Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation
    is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
    Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
    disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.

## 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
    Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
    License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
    must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to
    the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
    ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

## 5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its
    terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
    are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants,
    and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
    prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
    reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means,
    this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You
    become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding
    declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
    indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered
    Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding
    distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
    termination shall survive termination.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind,
    either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
    free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality
    and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
    You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
    warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this
    License except under this disclaimer.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or
    otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You
    for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without
    limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
    all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such
    damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
    party´s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
    exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to
    You.

## 8. Litigation

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant
    maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction,
    without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party´s ability to
    bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

## 9. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
    License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
    enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
    drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

## 10. Versions of the License

### 10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license
    steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
    distinguishing version number.

### 10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally
    received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.

### 10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you
    may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the
    name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).

### 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of
    this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

    notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font
    projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
    open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not
    sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold
    with any software provided that the font names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives, however,
    cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not
    apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license
    and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright
    Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting – in part or in whole
    -- any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new
    environment.

    the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold
    by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any
    software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included
    either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields
    within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission
    is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
    presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote,
    endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and
    the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this
    license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
    license does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.

TERMINATION This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.

        purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or

        anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works
        listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
        intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
        other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
        assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
        (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

"Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
        https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially
        equivalent to this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the
        same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the

                collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor
                waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
                under this License; and,

Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
                whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
                administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
                granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
    rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
    media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and
    limited by the following restrictions:

You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a
        copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute
        or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License
        or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
        the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
        to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
        Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
        that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
        under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
        does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If
        You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
        Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
        any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
        4(c), as requested.

You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a
        later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
        jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this
        License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the
        Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you
        license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
        License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I)
        You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
        Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the
        terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights
        granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices
        that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as
        included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
        Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability
        of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
        the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this
        does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the
        Applicable License.

If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
        request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
        reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
        applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties
        (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
        copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the
        title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
        specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
        information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
        identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author,"
        or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
        implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
        minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
        appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
        contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
        purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may
        not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original
        Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the
        separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law,
        if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
        Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
        which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
        jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the
        right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
        action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
        appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
        reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
        otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
    REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
    ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
    SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
    LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
        terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
        License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
        compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
        License.

Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the
        applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
        under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
        election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be,
        granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
        terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient
        a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
        the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
        validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
        parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
        provision valid and enforceable.

No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver
        or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
        There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.
        Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This
        License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
        terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September
        28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
        Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
        matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according
        to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
        law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not
        granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is
        not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or
            legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other
            relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis.
            Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights
        holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other
        rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only,
        are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for
        use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright
        and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and
        conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary
        before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly
        mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under
        an exception or limitation to copyright. More
            considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
        licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and
        conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable
        exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
        permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the
        licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other
        rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or
        described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where
        reasonable. More
            considerations for the public.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions
        of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
        extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
        consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in

            Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a

            related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui

            Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and
            Similar Rights.

Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of
            proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
            Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
            exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

            material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
            conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your
            use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public
            License.

Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
            requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance,
            distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public
            including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
            individually chosen by them.

Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
            Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
            databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the
            world.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this
            Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

                    making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical

                    License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your
                    use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status
                    by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

                    modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public
                    License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never

                    License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your
                    use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status
